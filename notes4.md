# Notes 4: Cloud Secuirty with DevOps
## Question 1
<sub> One of the intresting parts is AWS Infrastructure, how customers are in charge or manage a certain area while the AWS amazon is incharge of other areas. </sub>
<sub> Another one is how IAM is a flow chart from programmin which I think its pretty nice and helpful, this IAM reminds me of my current class in secuirty+. </sub>
<sub> 4 Different IAM ekements; Users, Groups, Policys, and Roles. </sub>
<sub> A seprate 4 ways of using IAM; management console, command line tools, SDKs, and HTTPS API. </sub>

## Question 2

> AWS responsbility "Security of the Cloud"
<sup> Physical security of data, hardware infrastructure, software infrstructure, and network infratructure is all what Amazon is in charge of sort of SOL (service of level) that a customer should be reciving. </sup>

> Customer responsibility "Security in the Cloud"
<sup> For secuirty in the cloud the customer is in charge of setting up the poper secuirty messure for whatever the customer would like </sup>

> Shared controls
<sup> Both amazon and customer share control over patch management, Configuration management and Awareness and traning.</sup>

## Question 3
<sub> Something that was new to me was the shared control, I think its pretty cool that amazon throws you on your own to learn there platform but along side they offer a form of help and assitance throughout the process and are willing to train their employess, but has aws customer train its own employess. </sub>
<sub> Another factor that stood out for me was AWS having MFA, Identity federation, and shared accesss to your AWS account. I find it fascinating that you can have Identity federation making it easy to move around from work station to work station as well as meeting rooms this feature makes it very very easy to work since I have that in my current employer.

## Question 4 
 <sub> My question is if IAM roles are different then IAM users, since the users have the same roles or the roles are users. </sub>
