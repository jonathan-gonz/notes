# Notes 10: Automatic Scaling & Monitoring
## Question 1
<sub> Load Balancing servers under two ways static load balancing algorithms and dyanamic load balacning. </sub>
<sub> Static load balancing is just a way to take a load with asking quesitons such as taking loads for whatever server needs help, where dynamic load balacing is where the load is taken from the server with not much of load, asking if it needs help in other words.</sub>
<sub> There is modles of IT monitorying: sytem monitoring, dependency monitoring, integration and API monitoring, Busines activity monitoring, web performance monitoring, real user monitoring, security monitoring and ITSM monitoring.</sub>
<sub> AWS has a tatic of auto scaling where if AWS sense that their is to much of the work load it will implament elastic autoscaling where it will add more servers to uphold the load to balance efficiently and uphold it agreement to end users.</sub>

## Question 2
> Important Auto Scaling Terminologies
<sup> I think this is fascinating that AWS has a way to auto scale the service in which it needs to provide without having to ask unless the setting is not to be auto scale available.</sup>

> Load Balancing
<sup> It pretty amazing that AWS offers the same thing as a real servers to be able to uphold users needs when trying to join services.</sup>


## Question 3
<sub> Most of these topics I've learned through my server+ and network+ classes but I like that it is shared in the cloud as well.</sub>
 

## Question 4 
 <sub> None at the moment.</sub>
