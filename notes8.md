# Notes 8: Databases


## Question 1
<sub> DBMS (database management system) is where users create and maintain databses along with controll to access.</sub>
<sub> Databases are done by column, rows and even domains. In other words a properties of a Table; number, characters, data, and logical. </sub>
<sub> NoSQL, non SQL doesnt require any tables or colums in order to organize the information.</sub>
<sub> SQL is more of coding, you have bits for intergers, int for whole numbers, decimals, timestamp, uniqueidentifier (GUID), float number a precision between certain numbers, real is the same within float, datetime is just date and times, char is is a fixed data length, Varchar is a variable with a fixed data length, text is just a list of number that have a max.</sub>

## Question 2

> SELECT Statement 
<sup> What I find intresting of this is that its almost simple text like the words are affilated with the statement and straight foward.</sup>

> Amazon RDS (Relational Database services) 
<sup> it not really suprising to me about amazong having a database but it just pretty cool that it is an instance where it will be grown as needed</sup>


## Question 3
<sub> One thing that really stood out to me was how online and mobile gaming uses these databases for the data  like bandai namco studios that uses amazon RDS </sub>
 

## Question 4 
 <sub> No questions at the moment </sub>
