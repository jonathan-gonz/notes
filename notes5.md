# Notes 5: Networking & Content Delivery

## Question 1
<sub> There is different lay out for the network topology, such as Bus, Star, Nesg, Ring, Daisy chain</sub>
<sub> Routers, Hub, Bridge, Wireless Router, Switchs and Wirelessbridges are ways to connect multiple devices that help communication between devices.</sub>
<sub> There is 7 different layers to an OSI (open system interconnection) layer 1 is a physical connection which is reponsible for transmission reception of raw data between devices. Layer 2 is data link which provides node to node transfers (direct trasnfers). Layer 3 is Network this layer provides trasnfer of variable length data sequences or packets in other words. Layer 4 trasnport helps with the needs to trasnfer information while maintanining the quality of service function. Layer 5 Session is the layer of dialogues between computers from local to remote. Layer 6 Presentation is the layer that lay out or mapping of application. Layer 7 is the Application layer which is the closest to the end user. </sub>
<sub> CIDR (classless inter-domain routing) are ways to express IP addresss with a slash that tell you the bits in the routing prefix. so 192.0.2.0/24 means there is a 24 bits</sub>

## Question 2

> IP address is 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a host (computer or other device, such as a printer or router) on a TCP/IP network. 
<sup> IP address can be set to certain devices such as pritner, microphone, moniters etc..   </sup>

> VPC has a default network interface that is assigned a private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.
<sup> VPC get auto assaigned but the VPC can not be connected to a primary network interface from an istance</sup>

> A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed. Each route specifies a destination and a target. The destination is the destination CIDR block where you want traffic from your subnet to go.
<sup> The subnet deteremins where the IP is set to go to, such as printers and other sorts of equiment and users to end up at. </sup>

## Question 3
<sub> I never knew how AWS can be the same as a regular server/network. Like with topology and OSI, IP address, VPC. </sub>
<sub> 

## Question 4 
 <sub> No question at the momnet just alot of new information </sub>
