# Notes 3: Cloud Global Infrastructure
## Question 1
<sub> SLA, you pay for a level of services that is agreed on </sub>
<sub> It is best to find a AZ around you to optimize latency </sub> 
<sub> Amazon have server center sizes of football fields, and invest in larger amount of money into cooling.</sub>
<sub> AWS offers Computing, storage, databases, networking. </sub>

## Question 2
>Data Center is a gootball-gield sized building completely dedicated to connecting computer clusters to the internert or private corporate network.

<sup> I found this very intresting becuase I always thought it was just small servers in a room with offices around, not a large amount of servers inside a building another thing is that this one single data center is just a small fraction of the data centers near by if anything. </sup>

>When your application is being accessed by your users, it should be blazing fast. 
<sup> One thing I found very intresting about this was being able to cloudping the nearest cloudss to make sure you can connect to a cloud with the lowest latency, within seconds I was able to see the lowest latency web server. </sup>

## Question 3
<sub> One of the few things I've learn was how AWS has different zones and how they are resposable for load balancing in case in emergancy </sub>
<sub> Another factor was finding the cost, I do think this is very helpfufl when it comes to finding out the cost without having to take someone day and speaking or trying to get ahold of someone. </sub>

## Question 4
<sub> No question at the moment, if any come up I will possibly email ahaha. </sub>
