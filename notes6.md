# Notes 6: Compute

## Question 1
<sub> Linux is an open-source operating system, making it easy to fix, edit and distributed to anyone. </sub>
<sub> All of the popular OS's are avaible in AWS. </sub>
<sub> AWS has a wide varity of computing servers, such as virtual machines (amazon ec2) serverless which lets a user run code without managing servers (AWS Lambda) containers which is a computing servers that allows mutiple workloads within in a single OS and aswell as PaaS, which allows company access to build run and develop in AWS.  </sub>
<sub> VMwarecloud is another computing severs that gives a hybrid cloud without hardware.</sub>

## Question 2

> Instances are virtualized servers, allowing you to change their capabilities with a button or an API call.
<sup> I think this is pretty intresting because its still mind blowing ot me that cloud comuting can give you a real but yet fake computer with a very little cost to be able to code, build and run servers all over the cloud. </sup>

> Can you have two or more operating systems on one computer?
<sup> I find this very intresting since I'm not completely in the would of I.T I dont find a reason why to run more than 1 OS, but being able to do so one a cloud everiment seems very intresting to do so</sup>

>  "You can have compute instances instantly"
<sup> I found this complately amazing since you can simply add how many and what kind of OS is needed, futher in the video they talk about how you can use </sup>

## Question 3
<sub> One part I really enjoyed leanring was the different types of computing instances, such the accelerated compuing for machine learning. </sub>
<sub> 

## Question 4 
 <sub> My only question is if it is expland as you go or use less of whats needed does the computing change when you sudendly need more ? like would it change everying that is needed like would it give you a promt? or will it suggest what would be better to upgrade?</sub>
