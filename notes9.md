# Notes 9: Cloud Architecture
## Question 1
<sub> AWS has failure back ups such as: mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to failure (MTTF), mean time to repair (MTTR). There is a mixure of MTTF + MTTR it would fall into MTBF between failures. </sub>
<sub> AWS is has a level or agreement it has to adhear by to the customers which use AWS it is known as SLA (service level agreement): -provudes clear expextations by the provider, -metric that are measued by individual service, -availability is provided in percentage per year, and -Penalties are laid out if service levels are not met. </sub>
<sub> AWS has tools to have best practice and to have it perform higher and efficient.</sub>


## Question 2

> AWS Well-Architected Tool
<sup> This is amazing to have since they allow you to help your self to provide the highest level of AWS and be able to take to the highest level of services with help.</sup>

> Service Level Agreements (SLA)
<sup> This is pretty good to know that AWS has to uphold a a level or service between AWS and the user even to the point where they would have self penalties.</sup>


## Question 3
<sub> A few things I found pretty new and amazing is that AWS has to uphold a service agreement with penalties, along with agreements the user and AWS has to uphold. </sub>
 

## Question 4 
 <sub> What are the steps to have AWS accounable for the SLA?</sub>
