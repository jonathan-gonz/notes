# Notes 2: Cloud Economics, Billing & Support
## Question 1
<sub> Google has a numerous way of securtiy. </sub>
<sub> Google server room is more warm rather then typical server rooms </sub>
<sub> Amazon offer a wide variety of trainings in IT </sub>
<sub> Having cloud has a cheaper owner ship rather then traditional servers </sub>
## Question 2
> you can restrict which AWS services, resources, and individual API actions the users and roles in each member account can access
<sup> I found this very intresting because I learn this in my server+ class and to see it can be used in the cloud with nearly the same concept </sup> 
> IAM provides granular control over users and roles in individual accounts.
<sup> I find it intresting that most of the topics we are covering is over previous classes I've taken this makes me wonder if the classes I've taken are worthless since I can learn it in AWS without needing a certification.
## Question 3
<sub> One of the factors I've learn are the organization pricing, I find it nice that most of the cloud have pricing tools to help you find the amount of money being spent towards servers and structers </sub>
<sub> Another factor I like was Cost Explorer since it shows you where you spend the most money and that can help you realocate your expenses towards lowering another setting you find not so effective. </sub>
## Question 4
<sub> I have no current question. </sub>
