# Notes 7: Storage

## Question 1
<sub> Volatile memory is more of random access memory (RAM) were non-volatile memory is more of hard drive like HDSD, usbs, and floppy disk.</sub>
<sub> AWS has the same as servers where they have disaster recovery to recover from any instacnes that maybe have a fail over. </sub>
<sub> Data Lakes and big data sit in dataware houses and are used by Amaozn Redshift, AMazon RDS, Amazon EMR, and Amazon DynamoDB.</sub>
<sub> Plaintext is what is typed out without encrypted vs cipher text where it is encrypted. </sub>

## Question 2

>Questions for Backups
<sup> When I was taking my server+ class this question was often brough up I found it intresting how there is no defiente answer when working with cloud base servers compared to physical servers, I would see back ups for physical servers often be once ever 4 hours even for a small enterprise. </sup>

> Use Cases
<sup> This is intresting to me since there is 6 different ways to store and recover data used on AWS "Backup and restore", "Disaster recovery (DR)", "Archive", "Data lakes and big data analytics", "Hybrid cloud storage", "Cloud-native application"</sup>

## Question 3
<sub> One major stand out was S3 storage, what the differences between S3 comapred to other sotrages on the cloud to me it seems  like the same as any other type of stoage, even when compared to like dropbox. </sub>


## Question 4 
 <sub> One question I have is if deciding where the data will go will some of the AWS empolyee would be assiting with placing data away and if they do would they be able to decide where in AWS it would go?</sub>
